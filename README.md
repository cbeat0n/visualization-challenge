This is the repository for the 5th Module in the UofM Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

Observations:
* The percentages of mice that are Male and Female are almost identical at 50.7 and 49.3 percent respectively. Therefore, there shouldn't be any skewing of
* the data based on this variable. Discrepancy of 50.7 and 50.4 was also found, but this was to be expected due to how I cleaned the data compared with the gradebook.
*
* Capomulin, Ramicane, and Ceftamin all do not have any outliers based on the boxplots, so the data is reasonably compact. All information is usable. I was expecting an outlier for Infubinol but did not get one, most likely due to how I cleaned the data compared with the gradebook.
*
* According to the lineplot of L509 mouse, the medicine takes approximately 25 days to kick in. Up until that point, the volume of the tumor continued to         * increase. After this point, the tumor volume rapidly decreased.
